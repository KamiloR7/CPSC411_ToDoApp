# Simple To-Do app in Android Studio (Jetpack Compose)

My first ever Android app done in Android Studio for my CPSC 411 class! Built in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose concepts.
It lets you add tasks, complete them, and remove them seamlessly.

# App Overview
Add a new task with an input textbox
Tasks can be shown in **two sections**
**Items**
**Completed Tasks**

You can toggle a task between active or completed
You can delete tasks

Input validation is used to prevent "empty" tasks.
